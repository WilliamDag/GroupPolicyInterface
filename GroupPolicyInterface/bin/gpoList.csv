If the Internet Connection Wizard was not completed, this policy setting starts the wizard automatically.  If you enable this policy setting, the Internet Connection Wizard starts automatically if it was not completed before. The user cannot prevent the wizard from starting.  If you disable this policy setting, the Internet Connection Wizard does not start automatically. The user can start the wizard manually.  If you do not configure this policy setting, the user can decide whether the Internet Connection Wizard should start automatically."
Turn on ActiveX control logging in Internet Explorer,"This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer saves log information for ActiveX controls.  If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer logs ActiveX control information (including the source URI that loaded the control and whether it was blocked) to a local file.  If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer won't log ActiveX control information.  Note that you can turn this policy setting on or off regardless of the ""Turn off blocking of outdated ActiveX controls for Internet Explorer"" or ""Turn off blocking of outdated ActiveX controls for Internet Explorer on specific domains"" policy settings.  For more information, see ""Outdated ActiveX Controls"" in the Internet Explorer TechNet library."
Turn off automatic download of the ActiveX VersionList,"This setting determines whether IE automatically downloads updated versions of Microsoft’s VersionList.XML. IE uses this file to determine whether an ActiveX control should be stopped from loading.  If you enable this setting, IE stops downloading updated versions of VersionList.XML. Turning off this automatic download breaks the out-of-date ActiveX control blocking feature by not letting the version list update with newly outdated controls, potentially compromising the security of your computer.  If you disable or don't configure this setting, IE continues to download updated versions of VersionList.XML.  For more information, see ""Out-of-date ActiveX control blocking"" in the Internet Explorer TechNet library."
"Remove ""Run this time"" button for outdated ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer","This policy setting allows you to stop users from seeing the ""Run this time"" button and from running specific outdated ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer.  If you enable this policy setting, users won't see the ""Run this time"" button on the warning message that appears when Internet Explorer blocks an outdated ActiveX control.  If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users will see the ""Run this time"" button on the warning message that appears when Internet Explorer blocks an outdated ActiveX control. Clicking this button lets the user run the outdated ActiveX control once.  For more information, see ""Outdated ActiveX Controls"" in the Internet Explorer TechNet library."
Turn off blocking of outdated ActiveX controls for Internet Explorer on specific domains,"This policy setting allows you to manage a list of domains on which Internet Explorer will stop blocking outdated ActiveX controls. Outdated ActiveX controls are never blocked in the Intranet Zone.  If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a custom list of domains for which outdated ActiveX controls won't be blocked in Internet Explorer. Each domain entry must be formatted like one of the following:  1. ""domain.name.TLD"". For example, if you want to include *.contoso.com/*, use ""contoso.com""  2. ""hostname"". For example, if you want to include http://example, use ""example""  3. ""file:///path/filename.htm"". For example, use ""file:///C:/Users/contoso/Desktop/index.htm""  If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, the list is deleted and Internet Explorer continues to block specific outdated ActiveX controls on all domains in the Internet Zone.  For more information, see ""Outdated ActiveX Controls"" in the Internet Explorer TechNet library."
Turn off blocking of outdated ActiveX controls for Internet Explorer,"This policy setting determines whether Internet Explorer blocks specific outdated ActiveX controls. Outdated ActiveX controls are never blocked in the Intranet Zone.  If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer stops blocking outdated ActiveX controls.  If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer continues to block specific outdated ActiveX controls.  For more information, see ""Outdated ActiveX Controls"" in the Internet Explorer TechNet library."
Add-on List,"This policy setting allows you to manage a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer. Add-ons in this case are controls like ActiveX Controls, Toolbars, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) which are specifically written to extend or enhance the functionality of the browser or web pages.  This list can be used with the 'Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List' policy setting, which defines whether add-ons not listed here are assumed to be denied.  If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer. For each entry that you add to the list, enter the following information:  Name of the Value - the CLSID (class identifier) for the add-on you wish to add to the list.  The CLSID should be in brackets for example, ‘{000000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000}'. The CLSID for an add-on can be obtained by reading the OBJECT tag from a Web page on which the add-on is referenced.  Value - A number indicating whether Internet Explorer should deny or allow the add-on to be loaded. To specify that an add-on should be denied enter a 0 (zero) into this field. To specify that an add-on should be allowed, enter a 1 (one) into this field. To specify that an add-on should be allowed and also permit the user to manage the add-on through Add-on Manager, enter a 2 (two) into this field.  If you disable this policy setting, the list is deleted. The 'Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List' policy setting will still determine whether add-ons not in this list are assumed to be denied."
Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List,"This policy setting allows you to ensure that any Internet Explorer add-ons not listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting are denied. Add-ons in this case are controls like ActiveX Controls, Toolbars, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) which are specifically written to extend or enhance the functionality of the browser or web pages.  By default, the 'Add-on List' policy setting defines a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied through Group Policy. However, users can still use the Add-on Manager within Internet Explorer to manage add-ons not listed within the 'Add-on List' policy setting. This policy setting effectively removes this option from users - all add-ons are assumed to be denied unless they are specifically allowed through the 'Add-on List' policy setting.  If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer only allows add-ons that are specifically listed (and allowed) through the 'Add-on List' policy setting.  If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users may use Add-on Manager to allow or deny any add-ons that are not included in the 'Add-on List' policy setting.  Note: If an add-on is listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting, the user cannot change its state through Add-on Manager (unless its value has been set to allow user management - see the 'Add-on List' policy for more details)."
All Processes,"This policy setting allows you to manage whether processes respect add-on management user preferences (as reflected by Add-on Manager) or policy settings.  By default, any process other than the Internet Explorer processes or those listed in the 'Process List' policy setting ignore add-on management user preferences and policy settings.  If you enable this policy setting, all processes will respect add-on management user preferences and policy settings.  If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all processes will not respect add-on management user preferences or policy settings."
Process List,"This policy setting allows you to manage whether the listed processes respect add-on management user preferences (as entered into Add-on Manager) or policy settings. By default, only Internet Explorer processes use the add-on management user preferences and policy settings. This policy setting allows you to extend support for these user preferences and policy settings to specific processes listed in the process list.  If you enable this policy setting and enter a Value of 1, the process entered will respect the add-on management user preferences and policy settings. If you enter a Value of 0, the add-on management user preferences and policy settings are ignored by the specified process. The Value Name is the name of the executable. If a Value Name is empty or the Value is not 0 or 1, the policy setting is ignored.  Do not enter Internet Explorer processes in this list because these processes always respect add-on management user preferences and policy settings. If the All Processes policy setting is enabled, the processes configured in this policy setting take precedence over that setting.  If you do not configure this policy, processes other than the Internet Explorer processes will not be affected by add-on management user preferences or policy settings (unless ""All Processes"" is enabled)."
Install binaries signed by MD2 and MD4 signing technologies,"This policy setting allows you to manage whether Internet Explorer 9 can install ActiveX controls and other binaries signed with MD2 and MD4 signing technologies. Internet Explorer 9 does not support MD2 and MD4 signing technologies by default, because they are not as secure as other technologies.  If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer 9 installs binaries signed by MD2 and MD4 signing technologies.  If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer 9 does not install binaries signed by MD2 and MD4 signing technologies."

If Accelerators are turned on, users can install search providers as Accelerators to include them on the Accelerator menu."
Set tab process growth,"This policy setting allows you to set the rate at which Internet Explorer creates new tab processes. There are two algorithms that Internet Explorer uses.  The default algorithm has four settings: low, medium, high, or default. Low creates very few tab processes; medium creates a moderate amount of tab processes; and high allows the tab process to grow very quickly and is intended only for computers that have ample physical memory. The default setting creates the optimal number of tab processes based on the operating system and amount of physical memory. We recommend the default setting.  The second algorithm must be explicitly enabled through the creation of an integer setting. In this case, each Internet Explorer isolation setting will quickly grow to use the specified integer number of tab processes, regardless of the physical memory on the computer or how many Internet Explorer isolation settings are running.  If you enable this policy setting, you set the rate at which Internet Explorer creates new tab processes to low, medium, or high, or to an integer.  If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the tab process growth is set to the default. The user can change this value by using the registry key. Note: On Terminal Server, the default value is the integer “1”."

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can choose whether the certificate address mismatch warning appears (by using the Advanced page in the Internet Control panel)."
Site to Zone Assignment List,"This policy setting allows you to manage a list of sites that you want to associate with a particular security zone. These zone numbers have associated security settings that apply to all of the sites in the zone.  Internet Explorer has 4 security zones, numbered 1-4, and these are used by this policy setting to associate sites to zones. They are: (1) Intranet zone, (2) Trusted Sites zone, (3) Internet zone, and (4) Restricted Sites zone. Security settings can be set for each of these zones through other policy settings, and their default settings are: Trusted Sites zone (Low template), Intranet zone (Medium-Low template), Internet zone (Medium template), and Restricted Sites zone (High template). (The Local Machine zone and its locked down equivalent have special security settings that protect your local computer.)  If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a list of sites and their related zone numbers. The association of a site with a zone will ensure that the security settings for the specified zone are applied to the site.  For each entry that you add to the list, enter the following information:  Valuename – A host for an intranet site, or a fully qualified domain name for other sites. The valuename may also include a specific protocol. For example, if you enter http://www.contoso.com as the valuename, other protocols are not affected. If you enter just www.contoso.com, then all protocols are affected for that site, including http, https, ftp, and so on. The site may also be expressed as an IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) or range (e.g., 127.0.0.1-10). To avoid creating conflicting policies, do not include additional characters after the domain such as trailing slashes or URL path. For example, policy settings for www.contoso.com and www.contoso.com/mail would be treated as the same policy setting by Internet Explorer, and would therefore be in conflict.  Value - A number indicating the zone with which this site should be associated for security settings. The Internet Explorer zones described above are 1-4.  If you disable or do not configure this policy, users may choose their own site-to-zone assignments."
Turn on Notification bar notification for intranet content,"This policy setting causes a Notification bar notification to appear when intranet content is loaded and the intranet mapping rules have not been configured. The Notification bar allows the user to enable intranet mappings, if they require them.  If you enable this policy setting, a Notification bar notification appears whenever the user browses to a page that loads content from an intranet site.  If you disable this policy setting, a Notification bar notification does not appear when the user loads content from an intranet site that is being treated as though it is in the Internet zone.  If this policy setting is not configured, a Notification bar notification appears for intranet content loaded on a browser on a computer that is not a domain member, until the user turns off the Notification bar."
