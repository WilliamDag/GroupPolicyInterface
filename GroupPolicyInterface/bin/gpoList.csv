These zone numbers have associated security settings that apply to all of the sites in the zone. Internet Explorer has 4 security zones, numbered 1-4, and these are used by this policy setting to associate sites to zones. They are: (1) Intranet zone, (2) Trusted Sites zone, (3) Internet zone, and (4) Restricted Sites zone. Security settings can be set for each of these zones through other policy settings, and their default settings are: Trusted Sites zone (Low template), Intranet zone (Medium-Low template), Internet zone (Medium template), and Restricted Sites zone (High template). (The Local Machine zone and its locked down equivalent have special security settings that protect your local computer.) If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a list of sites and their related zone numbers. The association of a site with a zone will ensure that the security settings for the specified zone are applied to the site.  For each entry that you add to the list, enter the following information: Valuename – A host for an intranet site, or a fully qualified domain name for other sites. The valuename may also include a specific protocol. For example, if you enter http://www.contoso.com as the valuename, other protocols are not affected. If you enter just www.contoso.com, then all protocols are affected for that site, including http, https, ftp, and so on. The site may also be expressed as an IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1) or range (e.g., 127.0.0.1-10). To avoid creating conflicting policies, do not include additional characters after the domain such as trailing slashes or URL path. For example, policy settings for www.contoso.com and www.contoso.com/mail would be treated as the same policy setting by Internet Explorer, and would therefore be in conflict.

"Establish Tracking Protection Threshold;This policy setting allows you to establish the threshold for Tracking Protection Automatic mode.;This policy setting allows you to establish the threshold for Tracking Protection Automatic mode. The threshold sets the number of first-party sites that a particular third-party item can be referenced from before it is blocked. Setting this value lower can help prevent more third-party sites from obtaining details about a user's browsing. However, doing so may cause compatibility issues on some websites. The allowed value range is 3 through 30. If you enable this policy setting, the selected value is enforced. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can establish the Tracking Protection threshold by clicking the Safety button and then clicking Tracking Protection.;Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Safety\PrivacIE;TrackingProtectionThreshold;DWord;3;"

"Add-on List;This policy setting allows you to manage a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer.;This policy setting allows you to manage a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer. Add-ons in this case are controls like ActiveX Controls, Toolbars, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) which are specifically written to extend or enhance the functionality of the browser or web pages. This list can be used with the 'Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List' policy setting, which defines whether add-ons not listed here are assumed to be denied. If you enable this policy setting, you can enter a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied by Internet Explorer. For each entry that you add to the list, enter the following information: Name of the Value - the CLSID (class identifier) for the add-on you wish to add to the list.  The CLSID should be in brackets for example, ‘{000000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000}'. The CLSID for an add-on can be obtained by reading the OBJECT tag from a Web page on which the add-on is referenced. Value - A number indicating whether Internet Explorer should deny or allow the add-on to be loaded. To specify that an add-on should be denied enter a 0 (zero) into this field. To specify that an add-on should be allowed, enter a 1 (one) into this field. To specify that an add-on should be allowed and also permit the user to manage the add-on through Add-on Manager, enter a 2 (two) into this field. If you disable this policy setting, the list is deleted.

"Deny all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List;This policy setting allows you to ensure that any Internet Explorer add-ons not listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting are denied.;This policy setting allows you to ensure that any Internet Explorer add-ons not listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting are denied. Add-ons in this case are controls like ActiveX Controls, Toolbars, and Browser Helper Objects (BHOs) which are specifically written to extend or enhance the functionality of the browser or web pages. By default, the 'Add-on List' policy setting defines a list of add-ons to be allowed or denied through Group Policy. However, users can still use the Add-on Manager within Internet Explorer to manage add-ons not listed within the 'Add-on List' policy setting. This policy setting effectively removes this option from users - all add-ons are assumed to be denied unless they are specifically allowed through the 'Add-on List' policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer only allows add-ons that are specifically listed (and allowed) through the 'Add-on List' policy setting. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users may use Add-on Manager to allow or deny any add-ons that are not included in the 'Add-on List' policy setting. Note: If an add-on is listed in the 'Add-on List' policy setting, the user cannot change its state through Add-on Manager (unless its value has been set to allow user management - see the 'Add-on List' policy for more details).;Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ext;RestrictToList;DWord;1;0"

"[Protection from Zone Elevation] Internet Explorer Processes;If you enable this policy setting, any zone can be protected from zone elevation by Internet Explorer processes.;Internet Explorer places restrictions on each Web page it opens. The restrictions are dependent upon the location of the Web page (Internet, Intranet, Local Machine zone, etc.). Web pages on the local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making the Local Machine security zone a prime target for malicious users. Zone Elevation also disables JavaScript navigation if there is no security context. If you enable this policy setting, any zone can be protected from zone elevation by Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, no zone receives such protection for Internet Explorer processes.
